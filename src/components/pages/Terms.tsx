              carefully before using the ConnectCause website and platform (the
              "Service") operated by ConnectCause ("us", "we", or "our").
            </p>

            <p>
              Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your
              acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply
              to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

            <p>
              By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these
              Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may

            </h2>

            <p>
              When you create an account with us, you must provide information
              that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to
              do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in
              immediate termination of your account on our Service.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to
              access the Service and for any activities or actions under your
              password, whether your password is with our Service or a
              third-party service.
            </p>

            <p>
              You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You
              must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of
              security or unauthorized use of your account.

            </h2>

            <p>
              ConnectCause facilitates donations between individuals and
              registered NGOs. By making a donation through our Service, you
              agree to the following:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                You authorize us to charge your payment method for the amount
                you specify.
              </li>
              <li>
                You understand that standard payment processing fees may apply
                to your donation.
              </li>
              <li>
                You acknowledge that donations are made directly to the NGO and
                not to ConnectCause.
              </li>
              <li>
                You understand that the tax-deductible status of your donation
                depends on the NGO's status and your local tax laws.

            <p>
              While we make reasonable efforts to verify the legitimacy of NGOs
              on our platform, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of all
              information provided by these organizations. Users are encouraged
              to conduct their own research before making donations or
              participating in events.
